# IBM Bob Modernization Log

## Entry 1: Baseline freeze (2026-09-29)
- Area: Repository
- Before: Existing Ledger v2 app, no frozen reference
- Action: Tagged pre-bob-baseline-2026-09-29 at commit 41339c6; added docs/BASELINE-2026-09-29.md (09751ab); created branch bob/ledger-production-readiness
- Verification: Tag and branch pushed to GitHub
- Owner: Terrance

## Entry 2: Bob Phase 1 read-only assessment (2026-10-03)
- Area: Whole repository
- Bob task: Read-only audit (architecture, API, AI flow, security, tests, README claims, ranked backlog)
- Process note: A first run happened in a different repo (The-Ledger-) and wrote a file despite a no-write instruction. Caught on review; that output was discarded. The audit was re-run in The-Ledgerv2, which wrote nothing until one explicitly authorized write of the report.
- Output: docs/IBM_BOB_PHASE1_ASSESSMENT.md, committed unedited (7c9423d)
- Owner: Terrance

## Entry 3: Human verification of Bob's findings (2026-10-03)
- Method: grep/sed checks against server.ts, ContractAnalyzer.tsx, git ls-files, plus Google's published model list
- Confirmed: Real PDF extraction does not exist; non-text uploads get canned contract text (ContractAnalyzer.tsx). Server returns err.message to the browser. No stripe package in package.json or server.ts.
- Incorrect: "gemini-3.6-flash is not a real model" (it is listed as a current model; Bob's suggested replacements are shut down or older). "JSON.parse is outside the try/catch" (it is inside). "Two lockfiles in the repo" (only bun.lock is tracked; package-lock.json came from a local npm install).
- Still unverified: Stripe stub details (server.ts 276-313); waterfall math divergence between client and server
- Human decision: Do not change the model name. Do not accept Bob's backlog as written. Sprint 1 scope pending team review.

## Entry 4: Ticket 1 plan, real PDF extraction (2026-10-03)
- Bob task: Plan-only comparison of client-side vs server-side extraction. No files written.
- Bob finding: Recommended client-side (pdfjs-dist, plus mammoth for DOCX). Cited ContractAnalyzer.tsx 205-210 (fake text) and server.ts (only checks contractText is a non-empty string).
- Human review: Agree with client-side. Bob again called gemini-3.6-flash an unknown model; Google lists it as current (second instance of the same error). Bob's claim that the document never leaves the browser is only true of the raw PDF: extracted text still goes to the server and to Gemini. Bob omitted the Vite worker configuration pdfjs-dist needs, and mammoth does not handle legacy .doc.
- Amendments for implementation: server-side cap on contractText length; replace fake-text fallbacks with visible errors; decide DOCX scope; resolve bun vs npm lockfile first.
- Status: Awaiting team approval. Branch: bob/pdf-extraction
## Ticket 1 — Local Verification

Ticket 1 PDF extraction implementation reached Stage 4 at commit `4b3b4b5`.

### Verification Results

- TypeScript check: PASS
- Production build: PASS
- Valid PDF extraction (`good.pdf`): PASS
- Password-protected PDF rejection (`encrypted.pdf`): PASS
- 10 MB file-size validation (`oversize.pdf`): PASS
- Empty/too-short text validation (`short.txt`): PASS

Runtime verification: **4/4 PASS**

### Bundle Measurement

- Main baseline bundle: ~1,423 kB
- Ticket 1 bundle: ~1,911 kB
- Increase: ~488 kB
- Baseline gzip: ~437 kB
- Ticket 1 gzip: ~583 kB
- Gzip increase: ~146 kB
- PDF worker: ~1,264 kB
- Server bundle: 14.3 kB -> 14.6 kB

Lazy-loading `pdfjs-dist` is recorded as a possible future optimization.

### Review Status

Local implementation and runtime verification are complete.

Independent teammate verification is pending. Ticket 1 will remain open until that review, automated tests, lint, build, and critical regression tests pass.
